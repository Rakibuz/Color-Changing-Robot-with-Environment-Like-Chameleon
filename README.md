# Color-Changing-Robot-with-Environment-Like-Chameleon
Apparently, the initial idea is to develop a robot prototype based on the color changing capability feature of a chameleon. The prototype that I developed it only can detect RGB(Red Green Blue) colors in Environment. It can be controlled remotely using a mobile or computer via Wifi. Here Normal LFR(Line Following Robot) chassis is used with 4 DC Motors Here the robot is controlled from a webpage via ESP2866 WiFi Shield Code for TCS-3200 color sensor,  L298N Motor Driver shield,  ESP2866 WiFi Shield are combined here. I am still working on it to build it completely capable of hiding itself with the environment.
Tech Stack:
•	TCS-3200 color sensor
•	Arduino Mega
•	L298N Motor Driver shield
•	RGB LED
•	DC Motors
•	ESP2866 WiFi Shield
